This assignment is designed to enhance your understanding of SQL concepts, specifically focusing on Subqueries and Views.
Subqueries are queries embedded within another SQL query, allowing for more complex data retrieval and manipulation.
Views, on the other hand, are virtual tables created from the results of a query, providing an abstraction layer for simplifying database interaction.

In this assignment, you will perform the following tasks:

Analyze Data with Subqueries:
Use subqueries to retrieve complex data insights from the Country and Persons tables. These tasks will help you:

Count the number of persons in each country.
Sort results based on specific criteria.
Calculate averages and compare values across tables and records.
Work with Views:
Create and manipulate views in the Product database. These tasks involve:

Combining and formatting data for simplified access.
Filtering data based on specific conditions.
Updating data through views while maintaining data integrity.
Aggregating data to derive meaningful insights.
Practical SQL Application:
By performing operations such as creating views, filtering data, aggregating results, and using subqueries for data manipulation, you will gain hands-on experience with SQL, preparing you for real-world database management tasks.

Each task in this assignment focuses on improving your problem-solving skills and understanding of SQL concepts like joins, subqueries, and views. This will not only reinforce your theoretical knowledge but also give you the practical exposure necessary for working with relational databases.
